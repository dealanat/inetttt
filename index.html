    <p>Mental health is just as important as one's physical health and i stand by it. We should not shame someone because they're asking for help. We shouldn't look down on them and say they're weak because they are actually so strong to ask for a hand. As a future psychologist, i advocate for an open-minded society. My future profession can create social changes, i will make a world where everyone i can help feels safe. Put your trust in me when I say that I am capable of creating a social change.</p>
